# SportStretch

## Description
SportStretch On The Go is envisioned as a mobile application that will connect professional athletes (NFL, NBA, UFC etc.) with legitimate bodywork professionals in their area. Athletes travel a lot for events and might be in need of specialized massage services during their travel, to help them recover from the previous event or training session and be prepared for the next. The objective of the app is to enable athletes to avail the services of Licensed Massage Therapists (LMT's), Sports Chiropractors, Sports Acupuncturists etc.
